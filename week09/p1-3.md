## Week 9 Assignment

## Week 9 Assignment

- The template for this problem is [airports.ipynb](airports.ipynb).
- When you are done, rename your file to `FirstName_LastName_airports.ipynb`
  and submit it via Moodle.
- In this problem, you will visualize the total number of flights
  and current temperature of the top 20 airports 
  using the 2001 flight data.
- This week's assignment is one long, continuous problem,
  but I split it up into three sections for easier grading.

This is where we are going:

![Top 20 U.S. airports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INFO490/spring2015/master/week09/images/top20.svg)

The circles are the top 20 airports in the U.S.
  The size of each circle is proportional to the total number of
  arrivals and departures in 2001.
  The redder the color, the higher the temperature;
  the bluer the color, the lower the temperature.
  Thus, you will visualize three pieces of information in one plot:
  the location of major airports, the size of the airports,
  and the current temperature.
