## Week 9 Assignment

## Week 9 Assignment

- The template for this problem is [airports.ipynb](airports.ipynb).
- When you are done, rename your file to `FirstName_LastName_airports.ipynb`
  and submit it via Moodle.
- In this problem, you will visualize the total number of flights
  and current temperature of the top 20 airports 
  using the 2001 flight data.
- This week's assignment is one long, continuous problem,
  but I split it up into three sections for easier grading.

This is where we are going:
