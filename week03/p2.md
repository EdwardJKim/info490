### Problem 3.2. A famous simple interview question.

This problem is a famous programming job interview question designed to filter out those who think they can program but in reality can't. If you can easily solve this problem, you are already better than 99% of job candidates who apply for a programming job. The problem statement is simple:

- Print every number from 1 to 100.
- If the number is a multiple of 4, print "info" instead.
- If the number is a multiple of 6, print "matics" instead.
- If the number is a multiple of 4 _and_ 6, print "informatics" instead.
