## Notes on Automated Grading

For the instructor's grades, your code will very likely be graded
**automatically** using Bash and Python scripts written by the TA. Thus, it is
important that you

- read the instructions carefully,
- grab the template file `<firstname>-<lastname>-<projectname>.ipynb` that
  corresponds to each problem from GitHub (see [Workflow](workflow.md),
- **do not** change the function names or arguments if they are given in the
  template files, and
- try to reproduce the sample output as closely as possible.

Is automated grading perfect? Of course not. That's where the peer grading comes in. Grading by your peers will hopefully balance out the shortcomings of automated grading. If you think you were graded unfairly due to a bug in the automated grading program, please contact Edward at jkim575@illinois.edu.
